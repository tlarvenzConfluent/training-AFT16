## Course Materials



## What has changed:

Newly drafted content:

- Introduction: Install Confluent Platform
- Module 1: Install CP via Tarball for Local Development
- Module 2: Install CP via Package Manager
- Module 3: Explore run-class Scripts and Environment Variables

## What to focus on for review:

- Do the lab activities work exactly as written?
- Is the technical information in the notes correct and learner friendly?
- Are there any suggestions you have that would make the learning experience better?

## Items that are out of scope:

- Modules 4 and 5 are still being drafted
- There is less frontloading of information on purpose. The lecture is just the bare information needed to be able to access the activity.
