By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Set up clusters per Best Practice Specifications
• Set up the network as per the Network Specification
• Provision the Confluent cluster and deploy any self-managed Confluent components as defined by
the Cluster Specification
• Set up Confluent component monitoring as defined by the Monitoring Specification
• Apply the security mechanisms defined by the Security Specification to the platform
* Anticipate the demands of cluster applications during scaling

**** Note to CDev: Not all concepts will need all of the following headers. Please use what's appropriate and remove the rest. Please incorporate images as much as possible. You can and should adapt this template to accommodate the concept. Please work with the guidance from the SME and work through all the important points. The follow sections are suggestions to help keep the training consistent between both the individual modules and the Adopting Confluent book.

Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:
◦ Managed Cluster
◦ Cluster Sizing
◦ Highly Available Platform Design
◦ Multi-Data Center
◦ Platform Networking
◦ Multi-Data Center
◦ Security Foundations
◦ End-to-End Encryption
◦ Secret Protection Design
◦ User Access Management
◦ Platform Monitoring
◦ Solution Observability


If you're not yet familiar with those topics, please see the sections of the Adopting Confluent book that carry those titles.


== What problem does it solve?

We need the log to retain all events forever, otherwise it is not possible to recreate a data store from scratch.
We need log consumption to be ordered. If events with causal relationships are processed out of order, the result will be wrong.
---

== Why is it important?

Describing why this topic is important to success with Data in Motion.   

---

== Who does this involve?

A brief paragraph or two explaining who (personas) cares about this topic and what their interaction with it is. 

---

== When does it matter?

A paragraph or two describing when this topic becomes important in the Data in Motion journey and what other topics it builds upon. 

---

== Concept (e.g. Carrying Technical Information)

This is where the instruction on the topic will go. The idea is to keep the training to be around 10 minutes or so. Keep your learner role(s) in mind and also where they are in the AF so that you can make assumptions about what they already know and meet them where they're at.

---

== Challenge your understanding

This is the place to try to challenge the learner with thought exercises, actual exercises, or challenges that help to reinforce the instruction.

---

== Additional resources

Please list additional resources, including white papers, blogs, podcasts, etc.
