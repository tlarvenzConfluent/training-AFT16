By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Apply the security mechanisms defined by the Security Specification to the platform

**** Note to CDev: Not all concepts will need all of the following headers. Please use what's appropriate and remove the rest. Please incorporate images as much as possible. You can and should adapt this template to accommodate the concept. Please work with the guidance from the SME and work through all the important points. The follow sections are suggestions to help keep the training consistent between both the individual modules and the Adopting Confluent book.

Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of XYZ. If you're not yet familiar with that topic, please see ABC.

== What problem does it solve?

What is the “big picture” here? What are the use cases? Why are we doing this? Why is this relevant? Should be informed/aligned with https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rLFQDGta9qb2ri5fRQhK9WJemoQ0x1SLfGPzRqBhamo/edit#gid=0[company messaging].

---

== Why is it important?

Describing why this topic is important to success with Data in Motion.   

---

== Who does this involve?

A brief paragraph or two explaining who (personas) cares about this topic and what their interaction with it is. 

---

== When does it matter?

A paragraph or two describing when this topic becomes important in the Data in Motion journey and what other topics it builds upon. 

---

== Concept (e.g. Carrying Technical Information)

This is where the instruction on the topic will go. The idea is to keep the training to be around 10 minutes or so. Keep your learner role(s) in mind and also where they are in the AF so that you can make assumptions about what they already know and meet them where they're at.

---

== Challenge your understanding

You will need to learn about the following:

What authentication mechanisms are available

What authorization schemes are available in Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud, and their relative merits

How to set up authentication for Confluent components and the applications that access them

How to enable and configure authorization

How to configure on-the-wire encryption

How to create TLS certificates

How audit logging works within Confluent, and how to enable and access it

You will need to do the following:

Develop a security design that defines:

Which authentication mechanism is to be used given your security requirements and available security infrastructure

Which authorization method is applicable within your deployment—centralized ACLs or Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)

What operations are logged in audit logs

What components are to be secured, and how

Deliver a security checklist for verification that your infrastructure has been correctly secured

Deploy Confluent Platform components with the selected security measures; validate it using the security checklist

Note
CP-Ansible and Confluent for Kubernetes support automated deployment of security features. See {AFT24} for details.
In addition, by applying {AFT74}, you can ensure that messages and/or their sensitive fields are encrypted at re
