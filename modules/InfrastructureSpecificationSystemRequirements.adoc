By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Understand the commands and outcomes that go into your production cluster's infrastructure


|===


Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:

* Data usage and cluster architecture plans

* Information on several operational items: 

  Total number of partitions in the cluster

  Amount of data ingress and egress for the cluster and its network bandwidth

  Number of applications or services accessing the cluster

  Types of queries or calls to be made by applications

  Data retention policies

  Deployment environment (e.g., cloud provider)

  Application availability requirements

Data usage and cluster architecture plans are needed before this task can be completed. Information on several operational items is required to complete the utilization estimates.

== Why is it important?

It is important to create a Confluent deployment with the correct hardware specifications and correct number of nodes for each component of the platform.

== Who does this involve?

* Enterprise Architects

* Platform owners

* Infrastructure team

== When does it matter?

A correctly sized cluster will ensure that the target performance and reliability requirements defined by the SLA are met. You should define a cluster sizing strategy before:

* Ordering hardware

* Cluster deployments

== Create your system requirements 

What type of cluster do you need:

* A production cluster: 

* A geographically redundant disaster recovery cluster: 

* A pre-production cluster, typically with the same deployment characteristics as the production cluster: 

* A dev and/or an integration cluster: 

You will need to understand how to size the following Confluent components separately:

Apache ZooKeeper: 

Confluent Server: 

Kafka Connect: 

Confluent Schema Registry: 

ksqlDB: 

Control Center: 

You will need to prepare a bill of materials for software and hardware procurement. For each node type, these documents should address requirements for:

Number of nodes at each CPU level or cloud service tier

Data storage size and data redundancy strategy

Memory size

Networking bandwidth
