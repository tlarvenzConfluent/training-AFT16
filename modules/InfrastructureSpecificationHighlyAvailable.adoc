By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Define what you need to do with self-managed Confluent components as well as your applications to ensure that you reach your target level of availability.

|===


Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:

* Data usage and cluster architecture plans

* The number of data centers

* The location of your workloads relative to each other

* The types of workloads (i.e., ingress, egress, or stream processing)

* Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

== Why is it important?
A Highly Available Platform Design allows you to:

* Identify and remove single points of failure.

* Work out how you are going to reach the uptime SLAs for your applications.

* Simplify maintenance by enabling hardware and software components to be taken down without service interruptions.

== Who does this involve?

* Enterprise Architects

* Application Architects

* Operations

== When does it matter?
 Highly Available Platform Design allows you to identify and remove single points of failure.

Simplify maintenance by enabling hardware and software components to be taken down without service interruptions.

You should define a availabiity strategy before:

* Ordering hardware

* Cluster deployments

== How available should your system be?
