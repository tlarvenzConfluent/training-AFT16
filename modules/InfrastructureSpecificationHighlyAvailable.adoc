By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Define what you need to do with self-managed Confluent components as well as your applications to ensure that you reach your target level of availability.

|===


Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:

* Data usage and cluster architecture plans

* The number of data centers

* The location of your workloads relative to each other

* The types of workloads (i.e., ingress, egress, or stream processing)

* Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

== Why is it important?
A Highly Available Platform Design allows you to:

* Identify and remove single points of failure.

* Work out how you are going to reach the uptime SLAs for your applications.

* Simplify maintenance by enabling hardware and software components to be taken down without service interruptions.

== Who does this involve?

* Enterprise Architects

* Application Architects

* Operations

== When does it matter?
Highly Available Platform Design allows you to identify and remove single points of failure.

Simplify maintenance by enabling hardware and software components to be taken down without service interruptions.

You should define a availabiity strategy before:

* Ordering hardware

* Cluster deployments

== How available should your system be?

Review the Multi-region Archetecture patterns to understand how to make your system as Available as possible, and then answer the following questions:

* How do you guarantee the availability of the streaming platform to applications?

* How do you ensure that applications see a consistent view of the data?

* How do you recover the platform and surrounding applications within a given set of RPO and RTO constraints?

* What sort of broker and topic configuration is necessary to meet your data durability objectives?

* Define your platform RPO and RTO.

* Map out the data flows between applications.

* Show where applications reside physically and what subsets of data each application instance operates on. Questions to be answered include:

* Do applications have a preferred datacenter due to physical dependencies without which they could not run (e.g., specialized hardware or the presence of a mainframe)?

* Do application instances run in multiple locations concurrently (hot-hot), or are they deployed in a single place and failed over when necessary (hot-cold)?

* Put together a datacenter outage plan spreadsheet that enumerates regional failure scenarios and how each component of the platform and the surrounding applications will behave during regular operation, failover, and fail-back.

* Prepare a deployment architecture document with the above information and a strategy for addressing RPO and RTO objectives. This document should contain a set of deployment diagrams.

* Determine your uptime requirement based on your SLA objectives. You can use the uptime claculator for this as well.

* Create a spreadsheet to identify the individual elements that need to be made highly available and work out the strategy to do that.

* List each component in the overall architecture
      
  Kafka Connect connectors

  Streaming applications

  Source and sink systems

* Define impact if the component fails.

  Given the failure, how do you ensure the dependant components keep running?

  How long would the service be down before backup took over?

* Produce a Deployment Architecture that documents how to address availability requirement for each platform component.
For on-premise or multi-region cloud deployments, this will be an extension of the document produced in {AFT29}.

* Prepare a Deployment Validation Checklist from the Deployment Architecture document.
