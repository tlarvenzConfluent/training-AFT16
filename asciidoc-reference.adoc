== AsciiDoc Documentation

This document is an ok primer on the Asciidoctor text processor, but if you need more help, check out the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc Documentation, window="_blank"]!

NOTE: In the raw adoc file, notice the `window="_blank"` attribute for the link above. This will make it so the link will be opened in a new tab when the user clicks on it. As a shorthand, you can just use an `^` instead! For example, check out the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro-attribute-parsing/#blank-window-shorthand[docs^]





== This is a Subtitle

This is a paragraph of regular text.

This is a paragraph with a *bold* word and an _italicized_ word. *_Bold italic_* is also possible.

Words can also have internal b**ol**d and it__ali__c formatting.

Some constrained `monospace text`, and some ``u``nconstrained ``m``onospace ``t``ext. Let's keep adding to this line so that it wraps around and then we hit it with some code like this `bootstrap.servers` and then more stuff

* `starts with code` and then non code
** non code and then `code` and some more +
`code`

Some Superscript^®^ text and some subscript text: H~2~O.
